For people who are looking for npm version of @nicolo-ribaudo 's workaround, here are the exact steps I took:

delete node_modules and package-lock.json
add "resolutions": { "@babel/preset-env": "^7.8.7" } to package.json
npm install npm-force-resolutions --save-dev
npm install
npx npm-force-resolutions
npm install again
npm run build
I had to add SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true to .env file to make the build work without ejecting
